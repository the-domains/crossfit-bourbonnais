Health Decline is something that takes days, weeks, months, and years to develop.  
That is why being "unfit" is deceptive.  It kind of crepes up on you so to speak.  
The body doesn't just go from "fit" to "unfit" overnight.   
If you have been working out routinely for some time you will keep much of your fitness of many months beyond the time that you stop.  But, after about 12 months most of what you gain will fall by the way-side.  Strength will drop.  Endurance will drop.  Flexibility will drop so on and so forth.  
The best thing to do is just to keep on keeping on.  
If you have a history of NO exercise then it's your time to start.  It's never too late to start but when you do decide to start be about sticking with it...However you need to make it happen.
